## Harmonization of diffusion MRI datasets with adaptive dictionary learning

Coming soon : a Docker container for ease of use with a configuration file to control every parameter of the algorithm.

In the meantime, you can check out the preprint version at https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.00272

The manuscript detailing the original harmonization challenge which lead to this algorithm is also available from the publisher [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811919300837?via%3Dihub).
