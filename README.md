## Harmonization of diffusion MRI datasets with adaptive dictionary learning

Coming soon : Actual instructions and example, along with the new configurations file format (one file which conatains all parameters) I am using now.

In the meantime, you can check out the preprint version at https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.00272

The manuscript detailing the original harmonization challenge which lead to this algorithm is also available from the publisher [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811919300837?via%3Dihub).
